Carlota Sounds is a brazilian producer and artist. Carlota Sounds is the product of the authorâ€™s intimate expression. It is a job in which he deepest feelings are explored: from loneliness, euphoria to the widest reflections. 
The songs are based on the exploration of musical instruments, using the voices as support. 

This site is an attempt to show this experience.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
